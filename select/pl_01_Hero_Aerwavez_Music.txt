Underneath the fading sky,I learn to breathe
Every shadow whispers what I used to be
壊れた夢もcan turn to light
Even in the dark,your hand feels right
Through the silence,hope still stays
Guiding me through endless days
When the world begins to fall apart
I’ll be the fire burning in the dark
Through the storm I’ll carry all the weight
壊れないI won’t break
I’ll be the hero,even if I stand alone
Fighting for a love I’ve always known
Through the silence,through the fear I go
君のためにI’ll be the hero
I’ll be the hero
Every promise echoes in my veins
Every loss has taught me not in vain
From the ashes,I will rise again
Unbroken,stronger than the pain
引き戻してwhen I lose my way
Your voice is the light that makes me stay
When the world begins to fall apart
I’ll be the fire burning in the dark
Through the storm I’ll carry all the weight
壊れないI won’t break
I’ll be the hero,even if I stand alone
Fighting for a love I’ve always known
Through the silence,through the fear I go
君だけはI won’t let go
I’ll be the hero
I’ll be the hero
守るよI’ll protect you
I’ll be the hero
永遠に-forever true
When the night is cold,I’ll light the way
When your hope is gone,I’ll still remain
どんな時もby your side
一緒にいる、ずっとall my life
I’ll be the hero even if I stand alone
Fighting for a love I’ve always known
Through the silence,through the fear I go
君のためにI’ll be the hero
I’ll be the hero
