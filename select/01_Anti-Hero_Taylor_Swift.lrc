[00:05.39] I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
[00:10.37] Midnights become my afternoons
[00:15.19] When my depression works the graveyard shift
[00:18.34] All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
[00:45.34] 
[00:24.60] I should not be left to my own devices
[00:28.01] They come with prices and vices
[00:30.69] I end up in crises
[00:32.41] Tale as old as time
[00:35.02] I wake up screaming from dreaming
[00:37.60] One day I'll watch as you're leaving
[00:40.03] 'Cause you got tired of my scheming
[00:42.45] For the last time
[00:50.95] 
[00:44.30] It's me
[00:45.82] Hi!
[00:47.12] I'm the problem, it's me
[00:49.35] At teatime
[00:51.92] Everybody agrees
[00:54.96] I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
[00:59.40] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[01:26.40] 
[01:09.79] Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
[01:14.76] And I'm a monster on the hill
[01:19.68] Too big to hang out
[01:21.10] Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
[01:24.65] Pierced through the heart but never killed
[01:45.65] 
[01:29.44] Did you hear my covert narcissism
[01:32.24] I disguise as altruism
[01:35.14] Like some kind of congressman
[01:36.74] Tale as old as time
[01:39.48] I wake up screaming from dreaming
[01:41.84] One day I'll watch as you're leaving
[01:44.51] And life will lose all its meaning
[01:46.97] For the last time
[01:55.47] 
[01:48.82] It's me
[01:50.32] Hi!
[01:51.54] I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
[01:53.66] At teatime
[01:56.57] Everybody agrees
[01:59.29] I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
[02:03.68] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[02:30.68] 
[02:13.92] I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
[02:18.93] She thinks I left them in the will
[02:24.08] The family gathers 'round and reads it
[02:26.78] And then someone screams out
[02:29.00] "She's laughing up at us from hell!"
[02:47.00] 
[02:33.41] It's me
[02:34.86] Hi!
[02:35.83] I'm the problem, it's me
[02:38.26] It's me
[02:39.72] Hi!
[02:41.85] I'm the problem, it's me
[02:53.85] 
[02:43.46] It's me
[02:44.78] Hi!
[02:46.87] Everybody agrees
[02:48.26] Everybody agrees
[02:56.26] 
[02:53.17] It's me
[02:54.66] Hi! (Hi!)
[02:55.92] I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
[02:58.01] At teatime
[03:00.65] Everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
[03:03.54] I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
[03:08.08] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
